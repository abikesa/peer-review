- This study addresses the impact of donor-recipient relationships on long-term outcomes in living-related donor kidney transplantation. But this topic hasn't previously been reported because there's no reason to expect worse outcomes in light of other more significant risk factors such as immunosuppressive regimen, compliance, HLA-matching, and donor-specific antibody in the recipient. Also, since most potential unrelated donors are prohibited from donating in China, the study of related donors lacks an appropriate reference population against which to assess the impact of donor-recipient relationship related. The inclusion of spousal donors may serve as control, but it is very limiting for various reasons (a spousal relationship is constrained by age and sex differences from the recipient). But if the authors have a biologically plausible hypothesis as to why this should concern us, then they haven't motivated their study thus.
- Empirically reporting risk for sibling, spouse, mother-to-father, and father-to-mother leaves the reader wondering whether we should look out for a risk gradient or any difference across the groups. Which brings us to the most important limitation of the empirical aspect of this study: the sample size of 598 is far too small to permit a study across five Strata (i.e., this should be a stratified analysis), which adjusting for well-established risk factors for poor outcomes
- Of what use to clinical decisions, hospital guidelines, and national policy are this study's findings? No aspect of this manuscript addresses this question and, as such, the value to the reader remains elusive.
