### Peer Review for AJU-2024-0257: "The Impact of Donor-Recipient Relationship on Long-Term Outcomes in Living-Related Donor Kidney Transplantation"

**Reviewer: [Your Name]**

---

#### General Comments:

This study addresses an important topic in renal transplantation by evaluating the impact of donor-recipient relationships on long-term outcomes in living-related donor kidney transplantation (LRKT). The manuscript provides valuable insights and contributes to the existing literature by presenting data over a substantial follow-up period. However, there are several areas where the manuscript could be improved for clarity, depth, and presentation.

---

#### 1. Individual/Passion/Challenges

The authors have undertaken a significant challenge in exploring the influence of donor-recipient relationships on graft survival. This study is commendable for its long-term follow-up and the large sample size from a single center, providing a robust dataset for analysis.

---

#### 2. Knowledge/Capabilities

The manuscript demonstrates a good understanding of the factors influencing graft survival in LRKT. The analysis of different donor-recipient pairings provides a nuanced view of how familial relationships impact long-term outcomes.

- **Strengths:** The authors effectively utilize a variety of statistical methods, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression, to assess graft survival rates and identify risk factors for graft loss.
- **Areas for Improvement:** While the manuscript covers a broad timeframe, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the immunosuppressive regimens used and how these may have evolved over the study period. This context would help readers understand the potential impact of treatment changes on the outcomes observed.

---

#### 3. Tools/Leverage

The study employs appropriate statistical tools and methodologies to analyze the data. However, the presentation of these tools and the results can be enhanced for better comprehension.

- **Clarity in Data Presentation:** Tables and figures should be more clearly labeled, with legends that provide sufficient detail for readers to understand the data without referring back to the text. For instance, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves in Figure 1 could be accompanied by more detailed captions explaining the trends and differences observed.

---

#### 4. Communication/Interpersonal

The manuscript is generally well-written, but certain sections could be more concise and clearer in their delivery.

- **Abstract:** The abstract should succinctly summarize the key findings and their implications. Currently, it is somewhat verbose and could be streamlined to highlight the most critical points.
- **Discussion:** This section should provide a balanced interpretation of the findings, acknowledging limitations and suggesting practical applications or future research directions.

---

#### 5. Team/Network/Leadership/Decisions/Feedback/Professionalism

The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the collaborative efforts and decision-making processes involved in the study.

- **Acknowledgment of Multidisciplinary Contributions:** Highlighting the roles of different team members and departments involved in the study can provide a fuller picture of the research process and underscore the multidisciplinary nature of transplant research.

---

#### 6. Accomplishments/Exceptional

The studyâ€™s findings are significant and have practical implications for clinical practice in renal transplantation.

- **Impact on Clinical Practice:** The conclusion that donations from spouses and offspring increase the risk of graft loss, followed by M-to-C and F-to-C pairings, is particularly noteworthy. This information is valuable for clinicians in preoperative assessments and decision-making.
- **Recommendations:** The authors should consider providing more detailed recommendations based on their findings, potentially influencing guidelines for donor selection in LRKT.

---

**Specific Comments:**

1. **Introduction:** The introduction provides a good background but could be more focused on the study's objectives. Clearly state the research question and the hypothesis.
2. **Methods:** The inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria are well-defined. However, the methodology section would benefit from a clearer explanation of how immunosuppressive regimens were managed across different time periods and donor types.
3. **Results:** The results are comprehensive but should be presented with more emphasis on the key findings. Highlight the statistical significance and clinical relevance of each result.
4. **Discussion:** This section should integrate the study findings with existing literature, discussing consistencies and discrepancies. Consider elaborating on potential biological mechanisms that could explain the observed differences in graft survival.
5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion is well-structured but could be more assertive in recommending changes to clinical practice based on the study findings.

---

**Conclusion:**

This manuscript provides important insights into the impact of donor-recipient relationships on long-term outcomes in LRKT. With revisions to improve clarity, data presentation, and depth of discussion, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.

**Recommendation:** Revise and resubmit with minor to moderate revisions.
